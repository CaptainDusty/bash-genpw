# password-generator

This is my Bash Password Generator. Capable of generating passwords in an Apple Keychain like manner, providing
    a result similar to ***-***-***-*** - whilst substituting similar looking characters for lesser.

    The result is a reliable, and secure, password generator.

Requires (GNU base):
    bash
    cat
    head
    tr

Usage:
    ./password-generate.sh
